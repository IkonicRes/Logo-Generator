## Description
I wanted to make an easy-to-use logo generator that uses inquirer to prompt the user for a shape, color, text and text color, then generates an .svg file based on the input. My aim was to showcase my understanding of Jest and to make the project in a test-driven environment, so there are over ten tests that I wrote along the way to ensure functionality. Not much else to it, just enjoy and let me know what you think!

## Installation
Make sure to install node 16 lts and from the project directory run "npm install" in a terminal. This will install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage
![App Preview](./assets/images/preview.gif)  
From the project root directory, type "npm start" into a terminal and answer the following prompts. You may use hexadecimal or color name for each color choice. The resulting file will be saved to the project directory at /examples/logo.svg

## Contributing
Be good and do code

## Testing
Run "npm test" from the project directory and the tests provided should run. Any further tests can be added with jest. For more information read the documentation at https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest


## Questions
